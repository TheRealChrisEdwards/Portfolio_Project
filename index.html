                  <p>Hey, my name's Chris! Welcome to my web development portfolio. After learning some introductory coding skills, I began to notice this common theme for how developers advertise themselves &amp; their skills on the web; through portfolio webpages! This is a great way for you to get to know me, whether you've seen me on social media sites like Facebook or Twitter, coding sites like GitHub, freeCodeCamp, or StackOverflow, met me at a conference or an event, or are a business representative or potential employer. Everyone's welcome! This portfolio is set up for you to really just scroll through the entire page, flowing from one section to the next in a fairly logical order. The next section features a page about me, my education, personal &amp; work experience, and a few other quirky details. The following portfolio section is similar to a designer's, where I display and describe various coding projects I've worked on. Some are completed, and some are works in progress, but they all have descriptions explaining their function &amp; purpose. The final section at the bottom is where you'll find all the information you'll need to contact me. There's a place where you can send me comments, and also links to my various profiles on social media &amp; tech sites. Feel free to explore my portfolio and let me know what you think!</p>

                <div class="well">My name's Chris, and this is my online portfolio. TheRealChrisEdwards is an online identity I use, because my name is suprisingly common. That being said, rest assured and don't worry, I do in fact know who I am. I'm currently learning front-end web development, specifically HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript. I originally started learning web development before it was the dynamic and interactive platform we know today. I'm talking about plain text files with .html extensions, a few images, and maybe a page counter if you were lucky. I started down the path of going to college at the University of North Texas, and getting a degree in Information Technology, which is geared more towards networking than computer science. Anyways, I originally had a plan for becoming a network engineer, because I enjoyed networks and network security so much. At that time, while I thought I knew a lot about computers, my knowledge was quite limited in scope. Once I began to understand how the whole ecosystem of computing, hardware, software engineering, networking, and web development all worked together, I decided to focus my resources on learning the powerful technologies that create the web. Since web development &amp; networking work hand-in-hand, I realized how limitless the possibilities were for me. Fast forward to 2015, I found out about
                <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>, a free online coding bootcamp, while investigating coding bootcamps to attend. I immediately became obsessed, quickly embracing the online community &amp; learning resources that are so abundant on the web. I got involved with local c0ders like myself, and here we are! The section below showcases some of the projects I work on currently for freeCodeCamp, some are my own personal projects, and some are collaborative efforts. Feel free to check out my work, and let me know what you think. For more information about me, I've included links to all my social media pages <a href="#ContactPage">here</a> at the bottom of the page. You can also check out what I'm up to on GitHub &amp; WordPress as well. Also, I've seen many web developers maintain a personal blog as their main presence on the web, but I've chosen to seperate this page from my own WordPress blog to establish a more professional profile. I've included a link below, however, for anyone interested. More to be revealed...
