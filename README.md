# TheRealChrisEdwards Professional Portfolio

This portfolio page actually started out being a front-end learning project for the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) online coding bootcamp, but I decided to incorporate so much styling & functionality including the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework, some [Material Design](https://material.io/) UI & JavaScript functionality that it eventually turned into a really professional looking portfolio page that I actually wanted to reference for resumes. This was the first legitimate project that I actually coded completely on my own from scratch, which gave me a great since of joy, accomplishment & pride. Since I've also featured this repo on my [GH-Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (which is the live web-hosting feature for GitHub users), I also wanted this portfolio page to be my go-to web address for anyone trying to look me up on the internet, and as my default webpage.
> BTW, thanks GitHub for the free web-hosting, good looking out :ok_hand: :wink:

Since this portfolio will be a continuously evolving project with subsequent changes & updates, it made since for me to deploy a remote repo on GitHub  
1. For the reasons listed previously  
2. To further gain knowledge of the Git workflow & utilizing the command-line interface  
3. To gain experience with maintaining a live deployed webpage

If you have any questions about any of the information here, or on my portfolio page, feel free to email me [@TheRealChrisEdwards](mailto:TheRealChrisEdwards@outlook.com), any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
